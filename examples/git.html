<li>Commit Changes: Saving your work locally</li>
<li>Push Changes: Uploading changes to the remote repository</li>
<li>Pull Recent Changes: Syncing your local repo with updates from others</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
In the Git workflow, you'll begin by "cloning" a repository, which creates a personal copy on your machine that you can work on. Once you've made changes to your files or added new content, you "commit" those changes. This is like taking a snapshot of your work at that moment. When you're ready to share your changes with your teammates, you "push" them to the remote repository, making it visible to everyone. Don't forget to "pull" regularly to sync your local copy with the latest changes made by others in the team. This four-step process—clone, commit, push, pull—helps maintain a smooth and collaborative coding environment.
<h2>Understanding Branches in Git</h2>
<ul>
<li>Branches are like parallel universes for your code.</li>
<li>They allow you to work on different features or fixes simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section><h2>The Merging Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Merging combines changes from different branches into one unified path.</li>
<li>It can be fast-forward or involve a merge commit.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
When you've completed your side adventure—whether it's a bug fix or a new feature—you'll need to integrate your changes back into the main storyline (the main branch). This process, known as merging, ensures that all your hard work is included in the final product. There are generally two types of merges: the fast-forward merge, which simply moves the branch pointer, and the merge commit, which preserves the history of both branches.
:::
</section>
<section><h2>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes branches disagree—this is called a conflict!</li>
<li>You’ll need to come together to decide which changes to keep.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
Just like a good team working through a disagreement, merge conflicts occur when two branches have changes that cannot automatically combine. Don’t panic! Git provides ways to help you resolve these conflicts. You’ll review the differences, make decisions about what to keep, and then finalize the merge so everyone can move forward in harmony!
:::
</section>
<section><h2>Best Practices for Branching and Merging</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create branches for each feature or bug fix.</li>
<li>Merge frequently to keep branches from diverging too much.</li>
